Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD student at NYU Steinhardt's [ECT Program](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/educational-communication-and-technology), and a doctoral researcher at the NYU Learning Analytics Research Network ([NYU-LEARN](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/learn)). 

My work encompasses human-centered design and implementation of learning analytics and the research and development of actionable, conversational analytics interfaces. 

Before joining NYU-LEARN, I worked as a research assistant at the [HKU CCMIR Lab](http://ccmir.cite.hku.hk/), with a focus on the R&D of user-centered, context-aware music recommenders through physiological sensing, music (audio) processing, and UX research.
