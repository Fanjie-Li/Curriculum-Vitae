# In this project, we conducted a user experiment with Moody Web to collect users' listening behaviors, self-reported emotional responses to music, and peripheral physiological signals during music searching and listening. The dataset built from the user experiment will be used to build the music emotion recognition (MER) module of the music recommendation system.

The state-of-the-art emotion-based music information retrieval (MIR) systems have focused on modelling music emotion from acoustic music features. This project aims to further personalize emotion-aware music recommendation via incorporating user-related modalities (i.e., physiological signals).

In this project, we conducted a user experiment that simulated a real-life music discovery scenario. The dataset built from this experiment will be used to build the music emotion recognition (MER) module of the music recommendation system.

**Highlights:**
- Designed and performed a user experiment to build a dataset with synchronized physiological signals (BVP, HR, IBI, EDA, TEMP) and user-labelled music-induced emotion;
- Built the music emotion recognition (MER) model using physiological features and music features.
