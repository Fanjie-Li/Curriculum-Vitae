This teaching development project aims to enhance the interdisciplinary and internationalized learning experience in the B.A.Sc. Social Data Science program.

**Duties:**
- Developed the curriculum assessment framework and associated instruments;
- Developed repositories of interdisciplinary cases, topics and datasets in social data science;
- Designed protocols for assessing the interdisciplinarity of studentsâ€™ capstone projects using learning analytics methods (e.g., Epistemic Network Analysis).
