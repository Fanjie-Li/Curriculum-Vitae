This teaching development project aims to enhance the interdisciplinary and internationalized (I&I) learning experience in the B.A.Sc. Social Data Science program.


**Current Duties:**
- Develop the I&I assessment framework based on a thorough literature review;
- Design the teacher/student interview protocol, pre- & post- teacher/student surveys, and document analysis protocols (sample documents: student assignment, course materials/handouts);
- Develop repositories of interdisciplinary topics and datasets for studentsâ€™ capstone projects.
