This teaching development project aims to enhance the interdisciplinary and internationalized learning experience in the B.A.Sc. Social Data Science program.

**Ongoing research:**
- A document analysis of the disciplinary breadth and depth of existing SDS curricula using Text Mining and Epistemic Network Analysis.

**Teaching development:**
- A set of criteria and instruments adapted from the literature for assessing interdisciplinarity and internationalization in curriculum design.
- A repository of cases, examples, datasets in social data science that incorporates interdisciplinary and international lenses, along with corresponding teaching strategies in using these materials (e.g., [datasets/cases](https://woolly-asphalt-79b.notion.site/Repository-of-cases-examples-datasets-65c95d3aab5d452a8bd5a6c0c66e9fef), [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Fanjie-Li/Tutorials-for-the-BASc-SDS-Program/blob/main/Wisconsin%20Breast%20Cancer%20Dataset%20(Sample%20Task).ipynb)))
