This teaching development project aims to enhance the interdisciplinary and internationalized learning experience in the B.A.Sc. Social Data Science program.

**Ongoing research:**
- A document analysis of the disciplinary breadth and depth of existing SDS curricula using Text Mining and Epistemic Network Analysis.

**Teaching development:**
- Developed the curriculum assessment framework (e.g., curriculum, learning design, graduate attributes) and associated instruments;
- Developed repositories of interdisciplinary teaching materials (e.g., datasets, cases, [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Fanjie-Li/Tutorials-for-the-BASc-SDS-Program/blob/main/Wisconsin%20Breast%20Cancer%20Dataset%20(Sample%20Task).ipynb)) in Social Data Science.
