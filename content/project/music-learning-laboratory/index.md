It is a common phenomenon for students to listen to background music while studying. However, there are mixed and inconclusive findings in the literature, leaving it unclear whether and in which circumstances background music can facilitate or hinder learning. In this project, we conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of five different types of background audio (four types of instrumental music and one environmental sound) on reading comprehension. 


**HIGHLIGHTS:**

A laboratoy experiment that collects:

- a series of cognitive, metacognitive, and affective variables using self-reported measures;
- a set of peripheral physiological signals (BVP, HR, IBI, EDA, TEMP) recorded by Empatica E4 wristband;
- participants' eye movement recorded by the Tobii eye tracker.

Investigate how background music affects learning performance and engagement based on analytics at both behavioral and physiological levels.
