title: Leveraging Background Music for Learning: An Interdisciplinary Approach
summary: It is a common phenomenon for students to listen to background music while studying. However, there are mixed and inconclusive findings in the literature, leaving it unclear whether and in which circumstances background music can facilitate or hinder learning. This is a study investigating the effects of five different types of background audio (four types of instrumental music and one environmental sound) on reading comprehension. An experiment was conducted with 33 graduate students, where a series of cognitive, metacognitive, affective variables and physiological signals were collected and analysed.

**Major Contributions:**

◼︎ Experiment facilitator:

- Designed and developed the Moody music App (iOS client with a Flask-based backend and the MySQL database) to facilitate longitudinal data collection in naturalistic settings;
- Performed acoustic analysis on the 10k music pool and estimated music emotion in the arousal-valence space via Support Vector Machines (SVM);
- Collected users’ motion data (e.g., sedentary state), heart rate, etc. using the Fitbit Versa smartwatch.
- Implemented the Multitasking test using PsychoPy based on specifications in literature, and refined an existing Python-based N-Back Test for assessing participants’ working memory capacity.
- Conceived the conceptual framework. Performed data cleansing and analysis using Python and R.
